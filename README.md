### Example implementation of Random SC based on CFB words:

RANDOM::RevealAndCommit() does all the job. _rdseed64_step() can be called in C++ to get entropy.
Calling smart contract procedures is actually just sending a transaction where destination is ID of the smart contract (DAAAAAAAAAAAA... in our case), inputType is contract procedure index (=1 in our case), inputSize is non-zero (544 bytes in our case) and input data are injected between inputSize and signature.
Random.h contains structure which needs to be filled, it has the following structure:

>    struct RevealAndCommit_input
    {
        bit_4096 revealedBits;
        id committedDigest;
    };

The logic is this:
First you do a commit by publishing digest of your entropy bits, then you reveal these bits. Then you repeat. revealedBits reveal etrnopy for previous commit.
So with each transaction you can reveal bits for already pending commit and do another commit right away.
To prevent people from not revealing we require some security deposit to be placed, it's sent as amount.
When you commit you get security deposit held by SC, after revealing in time you get your money back, otherwise they are kept by SC forever.
You decide the amount yourself.
Higher amount = higher reward.

Only implements lost deposit fees to Random SC shareholders.

Does not include entropy bits selling revenue to entropy miners/shareholders (needs explanation).
